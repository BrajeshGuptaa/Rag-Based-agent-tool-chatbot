2. Project set tuned to these skills (ordered by hiring impact)
Project 1: LLM RAG & Agent Platform (Core AI Engineer Signal)

Skills hit: LLMs, RAG, embeddings, tools, monitoring, prompt design, latency optimization.

What it is
A platform where you can plug in different document sources (PDFs, websites, APIs), index them into a vector store, then expose:

A RAG chat endpoint (answer from your data, with citations)

A tool-using agent that can call:

web search

calculator

database query

internal APIs

Key components

Ingestion workers: chunking, embedding, upserts to vector DB

Retrieval: hybrid search (BM25 + embeddings)

RAG pipeline: retrieve → re-rank → build context → call LLM

Agents: planning + tool calling with explicit JSON schemas

Observability:

log prompts/outputs

track latency, cost, hallucination flags

A/B testing:

route traffic between models or retrieval configs

compare answer quality and latency

Why it maps well to LinkedIn demand
Companies need devs who can safely productionize LLMs, not just call an API. This is exactly what current AI Engineer job posts are asking for.
